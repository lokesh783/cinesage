# Average weighted , Content and Collaborative Based Movie Recommender System
1) Python
2) Flask
3) HTML CSS JS
4) Firebase

### About
A Web Application of Movie <b>Recommendation Engine</b> based on <b>content based,Average Weighted , popularity, item-item (using Collaborative Filtering) and KNN algorithm</b>. This application will provide all the information related to that movie and the most interesting part, this application will provide you the top <b>movie recommendations</b> based on your search.<br/>The user has to first register and login into the application.
<b>HTML, CSS, JS</b> were used for frontend which was deployed using <b>firebase hosting</b> to serve the machine learning models to the Frontend.
This application uses <b>Content Based, item-item, KNN algorithms</b> to recommend movies to the user.<b>TMDB</b> API was used to retrieve all the information related to the movie and its cast. Here, feature extraction methods and distance metrics are utilised to generate recommendations.

## Algorithms Used

### Average weighted
This algorithm is mainly based on searching , sorting and basic implementation , formula for getting average weights rating
AVG WEIGHTED RATING = ((avg_Rating * vote_cnt)+(vote_Mean * min_Votes))/(vote_cnt+min_Votes)

### Popularity
Simple sorting on the basis of popularity

### Content Based Filtering Method
Feature extraction methods such as TF-IDF vectorises the text data and distance metrics such as Cosine Similarity computes the similarity between each item by calculating the distance between each vector.

### Collaborative Filtering Using k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Collaborative Filtering Using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) kNN is used to find clusters of similar users based on common movie ratings, and make predictions using the average rating of top-k nearest neighbors.

### Collaborative Filtering (item-item) Method
In general itemitem collaborative filtering worked better than useruser collaborative filtering, irrespective of the similarity
function used. It is beacause in real time the number of users are more than number of movies , so it give better results. Comparing the
similarity functions, it was observed the plain, cosine similarity tends to work better than pearson correlation, for sparse matrices. Tried using centered cosine, but it fails when users rate all the movies same, so dropped it. The value of nearest neighbor was chosen such that the mse loss is minimized.

 ## Distance metric
The distance metric used in this recommender is Cosine Similarity. 
Cosine Similarity computes the similarity of items by measuring the cosine of the angle between two vectors
 projected in a multidimensional vector space. With Cosine Similarity, non-binary vector values are taken into 
consideration during calculation as the values directly influence the position of the vector. Cosine Similarity 
focuses on the contents of the items and disregards the size of the items. Hence, Cosine Similarity is suitable 
for text documents with different word counts.
